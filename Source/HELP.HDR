Spawn a console process with colorized standard output handles.

cr [<app>[ <app_args>]]

Colorizer (cr) intercepts the standard I/O streams of a child process and
allows them to be colorized. How the streams are colorized is determined by
the CR_OPTS environment variable. The options given with the cr command belong
to the child process. In order to control the colorization of the child
processes output streams, you must first set the CR_OPTS environment variable
as in:

    CMD$>set CR_OPTS=<cr_options> 
    
where <cr_options> represents one or more of the following options:
    
    -e dec_attr | $hex_attr
        Sets the console attribute for the child's standard error stream
        (stderr).
        
    -l 
        When set, the background of the entire line being output is set to the
        currently configured backgroud attribute. When this option is not used
        only the characters written have these background attribute set.

    -o dec_attr | $hex_attr
        Sets the console attribute for the child's standard output stream
        (stdout).
        
    -s 
        Supress trailing newlines. When '-l' is in effect, prevents the 
        background attribute being applied to trailing new lines in an output
        block.

The value given with the -e and -s options are the console buffer attributes
which are set just prior to the stream being sent to the console. This
attribute is currently limited to a value of 255($FF) where the lower nibble
(4 bits) represent a foreground color and the upper nibble represent the
background color. Colorizer currently supports the following nibble values:

    0 ($0) - Black          8 ($8) - Gray
    1 ($1) - Navy           9 ($9) - Blue
    2 ($2) - Green          10($A) - Lime
    3 ($3) - Teal           11($B) - Aqua
    4 ($4) - Maroon         12($C) - Red
    5 ($5) - Purple         13($D) - Fuchsia
    6 ($6) - Olive          14($E) - Yellow
    7 ($7) - Silver         15($F) - White
